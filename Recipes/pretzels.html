    <h1>Pretzels</h1>

    <p>
      Homemade soft pretzels are irresistible—the aroma alone will have everyone
      flocking to the kitchen. A soft crust with a bit of chewiness, a fluffy
      interior, and a sprinkle of salt make these disappear fast.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour plus additional for kneading
      </li>
      <li>One (1/4-ounce package or 2 1/4 teaspoons) instant yeast</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons (2 oz) unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 large egg yolk lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 large egg white well beaten with 1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>Pretzel (coarse) salt as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C) Do not use a convection oven for this
        recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
        combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt, and stir to mix; add the
        water, butter, and egg yolk, and mix on low until the dough pulls away
        from the side of the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fit the mixer with the dough hook and knead the dough at the lowest
        speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes, adding
        some or all of the remaining flour as needed. Cover with plastic wrap
        lightly sprayed with cooking spray and let rise in a warm place until
        doubled, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn out the pretzel dough on a lightly floured board and knead briefly,
        about 1 minute. Cut the dough into twelve equal-size pieces. Roll out
        each dough piece into a 24-inch-long rope. Make a U shape with the rope.
        Holding the ends of the rope, cross them over each other and press the
        ends down onto the bottom of the U to seal, forming a “pretzel shape.”
        For small pretzels, cut the dough into 24 equal-size pieces. Roll out
        each dough piece into a 12-inch-long rope and shape the pretzels as
        directed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently place each pretzel on a parchment paper–lined baking sheet (two
        pans). Brush the tops lightly with the egg white mixture. Sprinkle each
        pretzel with 1/2 teaspoon of coarse salt, or to taste. Bake in the
        preheated oven for 14 to 16 minutes, or until the pretzels are browned
        and firm. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes
        before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
